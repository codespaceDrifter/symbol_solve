# symbol solve
all my math and physics knowledge recorded in c++ code for calculations and md files for expanation of proofs and examples  
using functional programming  
the datagen folder can generate questions and answers for AI training  
the visualization folder can generate physics simulations visualization

# parser
parses a string question to classes, passes the classes representation to the various evaluators in math and physics, they return a class, stringify the answer and return the string
uses latex syntax
