# Linear Equations:
a1x1 + a2x2 + anxn = b
linear system: a collection of linear equation with same variables

a system of linear equation has either
1: No Solution
2: Infinite Solutions
3: One solution

augmented matrix notation
[a1 a2 b1]
[a3 a4 b2]
to solve: go row by row down and eliminate column by column of the below rows

Echelon form:
1: all nonzero rows are above any row of zeros
2: each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of leading entry of row above it
Reduced echelon form:
3: each leading entry is 1
4: each leading entry is the only non 0 number in its column

vector: a matrix with one column. 
w = [w1, w2] 
R2 dimension
